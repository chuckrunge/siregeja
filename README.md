SIREGEJA

Siregeja provides utility methods for simple text reports.  It is intended as a supplement for sidacoja (data conversion for tabular data), but it contains the Row and Cell classes needed to create a RowCache.  Any program that builds a RowCache can run a text report.  

Standard report features (headings, footings, control breaks and totals) are supported.  Three of each are available.  In most cases, if a value is not provided, the users can provide it and pass it in.
